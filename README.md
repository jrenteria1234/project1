# MusicUp-Project-1

https://carolunita.github.io/MusicUp-Project-1/

Our application helps music lovers to find local music events happening in a span of 24 hours. 
By clicking on the events they can purchase tickets through Eventbrite. 
Users can also check what events are happening in any city around the world and allows them to save their favorite city for future reference. 
The website also displays nearby restaurants and local news.

We had the idea to put different resources on one page because besides checking what music events are happening, people might also be interested in visiting a restaurant nearby or check the local news to be informed, all of this can be done without having to use different apps or websites.

**Google Maps JavaScript:** The Maps JavaScript API lets you customize maps with your own content and imagery for display on web pages and mobile devices. The Maps JavaScript API features four basic map types (roadmap, satellite, hybrid, and terrain) which you can modify using layers and styles, controls and events, and various services and libraries.

**Google Places:** The Places API is a service that returns information about places using HTTP requests. Places are defined within this API as establishments, geographic locations, or prominent points of interest.
